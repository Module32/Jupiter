# Jupiter -  the free-to-use Discord.py bot
The repository for Jupiter, the multi-purpose bot built with Discord.py in order to provide powerful features for users, as well as a customizable interface.

Jupiter is a customizable Discord.py bot that uses an SQL-based database. I made it as a reference for myself as well as other people. It contains a magnitude of features that are helpful for Discord.py developers.

To install Jupiter's code, press the green `Code` button on top of the files. From there, you can download a ZIP file of the code and insert your own token.

Jupiter's code is completely open-source. Use it freely! No credits required (although crediting would be appreciated lol)
